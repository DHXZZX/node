The core concepts of AOP:

* Joinpoints

> A joinpoint is a well-defined point during the execution of your application.

* Advice

> The code that is executed at a particular joinpoint is the advice, defined by a method in your class.

* Pointcuts

> A pointcut is a collection of joinpoints that you use to define when advice should be executed.

* Aspects

> An aspect is the combination of advice and pointcuts encapsulated in a class.

* Weaving

> This is the process of inserting aspects into the application code at the appropriate point.

* Target

> An object whose execution flow is modified by an AOP process is referred to as the target object.

* Introduction

> This is the process by which you can modify the structure of an object by introducing additional methods or fields to it.
